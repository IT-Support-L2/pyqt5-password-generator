# pyqt5-password-generator

Advanced Password Generator designed with `Qt Designer`, coded with `python 3.8.5` and compiled with `auto-py-to-exe`.

P-GEN generates secure complex passwords composed of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits and punctuations.

Chars length must be a multiple of 4. Example of length inputs: 8 (minimum), 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, ect.

Else, you can generate the maximum of 96 passwords per click, minimum input is 1.

Everything run as expected, just when you click on `Export as txt`, input only the `file name without txt extension` and it will be automatically saved as `txt file` with the fileName you chose and in the directory you already naviagted to.
